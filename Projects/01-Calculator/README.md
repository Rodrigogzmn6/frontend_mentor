### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Using constants to simplify css

```css
.application.dark {
  background-color: var(--d-main-bg);
  color: var(--d-light-txt);
}
```

Succesfully managing state with useState hook

```js
const [equation, setEquation] = useState({
  number1: "",
  operation: "",
  number2: "",
});
```

Rerendering elements when needed with useEffect

```js
useEffect(() => {}, [theme]);
```

Using context to modify the theme across the entire web

```js
<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, changeTheme }}>
  {children}
</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

### Useful resources

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - It's the biggest JS library.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - It saves a lot of time and css code.
- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - A really amazing technology that helps you with some specific (or not that specific) topics.
